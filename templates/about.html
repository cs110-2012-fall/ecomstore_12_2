<h3>Our history</h3>
<p>Owner Michael A. Collins takes tremendous pride in providing quality products and services to his customers. Many San Diegans have considered him their "jewelry guru" since 1980, when he opened his La Mesa store.</p>
</div>
<div class="span5">
<p>
Jewelry has been the focus of Michael Collins' life since the day in 1968 that he entered a St. Louis jewelry store looking for a job that would help him pay his rent. Recognizing his talent, the store owners sent him to Kansas City for additional training and also facilitated his ability to earn a college degree in marketing/advertising.
<br>
<br>
Michael worked for a large jeweler for seven years, opening stores in seven different states. A competitor recruited him to the San Diego area, where he was responsible for several of its local jewelry stores for more than four years. After nearly a decade of working for other people, Michael realized the only way to have total control over the quality of the jewelry he sold was to have his own store.
<br>
<br>
Since 1980, that store, Michael A. Collins-Fine Jewelers, has been a fixture in La Mesa, and attracted customers from throughout San Diego. Word-of-mouth has been Michael's predominant advertising vehicle, which speaks to the high quality of his work. </p>
<p>
Michael helps customers bring their jewelry design concepts to reality. Starting with an idea on paper, he produces a wax carving and then casts it in silver, gold or platinum. Michael also loves working with color; he has three people who travel the world to find interesting pieces for him in all hues.
<br>
<br>
Michael offers:
<br>
<br>
The best quality diamonds.
Diamonds at the best prices.
Unmatched service and return policies.
The best jewelry guidance and education.
